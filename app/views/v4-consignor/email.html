      Dear Customer,
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-heading-m">
      There is a new legal requirement to tell the agency about future green list waste 
      exports under Article 18 controls
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-heading-s">
      Who we are
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We are the agency, the governmentâ€™s environmental regulator.  We regulate waste management for the 
      protection of people and the environment.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-heading-s">
      Why we have emailed you
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We have sent you this email because you are involved in waste imports or exports.
    </p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">
      From 1 April 2023 you will need to tell us about a future green list waste export under Article 18 controls. Green list wastes are non-hazardous, uncontaminated, single-stream wastes such as paper or scrap metal 
      that are exported overseas for recovery.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You will need to provide us with the information relating to each export of green list waste using our 
      new online service.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-heading-s">
      Tell us about a future export of green list waste
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The service will:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>guide you through producing a complete and accurate Annex VII form</li>
      <li>allow you to print a copy of the Annex VII to travel with the waste</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You will no longer need to scan and email your Annex VII form to us.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This service is part of our initiative to eradicate waste crime and create a level 
      playing field for all waste operators.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-heading-s">
      What you need to do
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You need to register for an account on the service to tell us about future
      exports of green list waste. Telling us about these exports in advance will become a legal requirement 
      from 1 April 2023, but you can start using the service today.
